# Command-Bank
The Command Bank is a structured, extensible system that transforms a code editor such as VS Code into a developer-centric intelligence hub. By organizing AI instructions into discrete, reusable command files, developers can interact with AI tools (like GitHub Copilot) in a declarative, task-oriented, and context-aware way.
